### Who the Fuck Am I?

I’m **0xcds4r**, a code-wielding maniac with 8+ years of tearing apart systems, reverse-engineering game engines, and squeezing every last drop of performance from rusty code. I live for the grind — C++, JNI, x86/x64/x32 assembly, and RenderWare are my playgrounds. My obsession? Turning laggy messes like GTA San Andreas into silky-smooth beasts, especially on Android.

- **Specialties**: Reverse engineering, low-level optimization, game modding.
- **Vibe**: psychopathy
